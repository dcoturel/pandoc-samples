# pandoc-samples
Samples of shell script using pandoc to create documentation

## Motivation

I'm attempting to create a documentation workflow for SMBs projects and deliverables. After a little research, got to a tool called pandoc https://pandoc.org/. I'm still testing and playing around with the tool and the different workflows. This repo is ment to collect them.
